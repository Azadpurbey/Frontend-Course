Add View Section to Blog


Let's add a view section to our blog, which represents the number of visits to our blog.
Although it would be static for now, we can change it to dynamic later.
So, we will use some text formatting tags to add the views section. The instructions are provided below.
Note: The text formatting tags are always inline.


Instructions to follow -
1. Add a separate view section inside the article in the container of the first image of the article.
2. Now, add 2 span's with content as: 'Views:' and '1,137'. Make these span's bold using the appropriate text formatting tag.

Expected Blog page is - https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001402.png
