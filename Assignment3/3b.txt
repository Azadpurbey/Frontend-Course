Finalize the Form

We have now build a form that accepts the correct input. But we have some problems in form for now.
The form values are not being submitted for now and the comment box is very small in size.
So, we need to make the form to submit the input values and change the comment input box.


Necessary additional information is provided below -
1. The comment box now has dimensions of 10*30.
2. The form is submitted by clicking on 'Post Comment'.
