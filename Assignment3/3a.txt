Code: Form Input Types

For now, we have created a simple form. But there is a problem that the inputs can take any value other than what they are meant to be.
So, we need to change the type of the input element for proper functioning. Your task is to change the type of input according to the meaning of each of them.


The meaning of each input element is provided below -
1. Comment - to provide a comment for the blog
2. Name - the name of the person who wants to comment on the blog.
3. Email - to provide the email id of the person.
4. Website - to provide the link to a website that belongs to the above said person.

The expected output is - https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001482.png
